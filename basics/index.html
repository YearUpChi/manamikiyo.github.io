<h2>How To Play</h2>
<p>The game begins with each player having 20 life points, so the objective is to knock your opponent to 0 life points. In order to do so you have to summon certain creatures and spells to attack! This involves strategy to build the right deck for your endgame.</p>
<h2>The Stages of the gameplay</h2>
<div id="video"<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fG3eXBccyWg" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>
<p>There are five phases within every turn of a Magic The Gathering. They are:</p>
<ol>
	<li>Beginning Phase</li>
	<li>Pre-combat main Phase</li>
	<li>Combat Phase</li>
	<li>Post-Combat Main Phase</li>
	<li>Ending Phase</li>
</ol>
<h4>Beginning Phase</h4>
<p>If you are the first player, you have to pull from your current hand any Land card. The second player has the ability to draw a card from their library. After the first turn, the beginning phase is to untap (turn from horizontal to vertical) any cards, activate any abilities that occur during untapping, and draw a card.</p>
<h4>Pre-combat Main Phase</h4>
<p>This is the phase where anything that isn't an Instant type card is summoned. This is by using the Land cards that are avaliable on the 'battleground'. Tap the Land to summon the card and, depending on the card description, activate its abilities. This is immediately followed by the Combat Phase.</p>
<h4>Combat Phase</h4>
<p>Any creatures that are summoned immediately, unless it has the Haste attribute, cannot attack. Any creature that is long summoned can be tapped to attack. Your opponent can use their creatures to block any of your creatures attack (and vice versa).</p>
<h4>Post-Combat Main Phase</h4>
<p>Any special abilities at the end of the combat phase is activated.
</p>
<h4>Ending Phase</h4>
<p>......you end your turn.</p>
<h2>The Anatomy of a MTG card</h2>
<p>If this is your first time looking at a MTG card, this diagram will help decipher. It is extremely important when buying and playing cards.</p>

</div>
<p><strong>Mana cost</strong> are the required land cards that are needed to summon a creature or spell card.</p>
<p>The <strong>card type</strong> and <strong>sub-type</strong> is the short description. The sub-type will help you if another card gives attributes to a particular sub-type. For example, the enchantment card Raised By Wolves adds one power and toughness to your creature for as many Wolf sub-type is on the field.</p>
<p>The <strong>Power/Toughness</strong> is only seen for creature-type cards. They mainly refer to the attack and defence of the creature. This is the second most important information when it comes to strategy.</p>
