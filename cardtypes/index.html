<h2>Card Types</h2>
<h4>Artifacts</h4>
<p>Artifact is a type of permanent and may also be a creature, or an artifact creature. That means that anything that affects an artifact or a creature can be used on an artifact creature. So if you have Naturalize, you can use it on an artifact creature.</p>
<h4>Creatures</h4>
<p>Creature is a type of permanent and will have one or other creature subtypes (e.g. Elf, Cat, Dragon, Wurm). All creatures have a power and a toughness and are the only card type that can attack or block. Some creatures have power and toughness depending on a certain thing, like Nightmare. Many creatures have abilities that boost their value and make them more powerful.</p>
<h4>Enchanment</h4>
<p>Enchantment is a type of permanent and may have the subtype Aura. Unlike the similar permanent, the artifact, enchantments are colored and never need to tap.</p>
<h4>Instants</h4>
<p>Instant is a type of nonpermanent and may have the subtype Arcane or Trap. Instants and spells with Flash are the only card types that can be played on either player's turn.</p>
<h4>Land</h4>
<p>Land is a type of permanent and may have the subtype Forest, Island, Mountain, Plains, or Swamp. (There are other less common land subtypes.) A land may be played only once per turn and only by the active player (the player whose turn it is) on his or her turn.</p>
<h4>Planeswalker</h4>
<p>Although you are refered to as a Planeswalker, there other planeswalkers you can summon to aid you. Planeswalker is a type of permanent and may have one planeswalker subtype. All planeswalkers have a loyalty and three or four abilities that add or subtract loyalty. Only one of these abilities may be played per turn. Also, if a player controls two or more planeswalkers with the same planeswalker subtype at the same time, all but one of them is put into their owner's graveyard.</p>
<h4>Sorcery</h4>
<p>Sorcery is a type of nonpermanent spell card that is used only in the main phase.</p>
